#include <stdio.h>

// A C program contains external objects, which are either variables or 
// functions. External variables are defined outside any function and available
// to all functions. Functions are always external, as C does not function
// defintion inside another function. 
// All reference to external objects(variables or functions), even from 
// functions separately compiled, are references to the same objects.
