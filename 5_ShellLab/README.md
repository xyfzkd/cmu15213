# Lab5 Shell Lab

The original tar file is `shlab-handout.tar` and the writeup is `shlab.pdf`. My solution is in `shlab-handout/`.

### Before starting 
Reading `8.1 - 8.8` of `CSAPP: 3e` can be very helpful.  
Make sure you understand the content in the slides very carefully, especially `15-ecf-signals.pdf`.   
Read the writeup very carefully. 

### Working on the lab
This lab is not too hard. A lot of hints are provided:  
1. Some snippets in lecture slide are very similar to the code for the lab;
2. The writeup provides strategies for most of the tricky parts in the lab, so make sure you read the write up very carefully;  
3. Make good use of man page;  
4. This page is very useful for solving `trace08.txt`: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28209525/how-would-i-check-for-child-process-changing-state-but-not-terminating
