# Lab3 AttackLab

The original tar file is `target1.tar` and the writeup is `attacklab.pdf`. My solution is in `target1`.

### Before starting 
- The video from `recitation 05` is helpful, make sure you watch it.
- This lab is mainly based on `Lecture 9 - Machine Prog: Advanced`, if you have done `BombLab` and have solid knowledge of previous lectures on machine programming.  

### Working on the lab
Compared with `DataLab` and `BombLab`, this is a much easier lab: as it is only based on one lecture and the code you need to go through is relatively short. The only thing that can be confusing is byte ordering: when you need to reverse the bytes and when you should not. `./target1/CI_level2/level2_CI_solution.txt` and `./target1/CI_level3/level3_CI_solution.txt` contains some notes and explanation on this issue.

### Other notes
- I did not attemp Phase5 as it is indicted to be very hard in the writeup and I have something more important right now :)  
- For `ctarget`, WSL fails to run it successfully; For `rtarget`, WSL can run it successfully. Remember to add the `-q` flag to avoid the `FAILED: Initialization error: Running on an illegal host [***]` error.
